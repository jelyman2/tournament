<p>A Python application to simulate 1-on-1 matchups and rank each player by the 
number of wins and other data.</p>

<h2>
<a id="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h2>

<p>The purpose of this application is to demonstrate basic interaction with a 
relational database management system via Python. This was a project crafted 
for the "Full Stack Developer" Udacity Nanodegree program in which I enrolled.</p>

<h2>
<a id="how-it-works" class="anchor" href="#how-it-works" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How it Works</h2>

<p>I was faced with two options: let the user run the script and have it behave 
in a demo-like fashion with pre-defined events OR allow the user to have 
direct control over the meaty portions of the application (a.k.a. the user 
database).</p>

<p>Run the script on the command line with a 2.7x python interpreter with one of
 the following arguments. If you do not, you'll be prompted that you forgot 
 to do so and will receive a list of arguments, anyway.</p>

<h3>
<a id="arguments" class="anchor" href="#arguments" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Arguments</h3>

<p>Here's a breakdown of all the arguments that can be passed by the user:</p>

<h4>
<a id="player" class="anchor" href="#player" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Player</h4>

<p><code>--new-player</code>: Creates a new player. You'll be prompted for a name and 
country of origin.</p>

<p><code>--delete-player</code>: Delete an existing player. You'll be prompted for an <code>ID</code>.</p>

<p><code>--edit-player</code>: Update the information for an existing player. You'll be 
prompted for an <code>ID</code>.</p>

<p><code>--list-players</code>: List all players in the database.</p>

<p><code>--list-ranking</code>: List all players in the database, sorted by number of wins.</p>

<h4>
<a id="match" class="anchor" href="#match" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Match</h4>

<p><code>--new-match</code>: Create a new match. You'll be prompted for <code>ID</code>s of two players.</p>

<p><code>--swiss-match</code>: Activates the swiss-style matchup function. This is an 
automated behavior.</p>

<h4>
<a id="data" class="anchor" href="#data" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data</h4>

<p><code>--latest-match</code>: Prints out the results of the latest executed match.</p>

<p><code>--lookup-match</code>: Allows the user to lookup a match by <code>ID</code>.</p>

<h3>
<a id="other" class="anchor" href="#other" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Other</h3>

<p><code>--audit-log</code>: All cool apps come with logging capabilities. While I never 
seem to be quite satisfied with what's being logged, there's data being 
recorded, anyway, and you can view the entries.</p>

<h2>
<a id="noteworthy" class="anchor" href="#noteworthy" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Noteworthy</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Since player <code>ID</code> numbers are unique, an <code>ID</code> of a deleted player will never 
belong to another player so in its place you'll see <code>[DELETED]</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Missing data will likely always return an exception.</p></li>
<li><p>I opted to do some of the data manipulation in the app for the swiss 
pairings, versus in the database query. My testing shows there was no 
performance improvement using the latter.</p></li>
</ul>
